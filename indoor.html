        <h3>YALE BED</h3>
        <p>The designer extends Yale X’s project idea to the night area, proposing again Yale’s softness and comfort for the headboard, as well as the refined aesthetics of the sofa’s stand as the hallmark of the bedframe. 
            The bed concept means a welcoming headboard, capable to offer the best comfort to relax, read or watch TV, a good mattress and a comfortable pillow. </p>
